          </div>
				<p class="lead">
				SnpEff is a variant annotation and effect prediction tool.
				It annotates and predicts the effects of genetic variants (such as amino acid changes).
				</p>

				<p> <h3> Variants </h3><br>
				By genetic variant we mean difference between a genome and a "reference" genome.
				As an example, imagine we are sequencing a "sample".
				Here "sample" can mean anything that you are interested in studing, from a cell culture, to a mouse or a cancer patient.
				<br>
				It is a standard procedure to compare your sample sequences against the corresponding "reference genome".
				For instance you may compare the cancer patient genome against the current "reference genome" (at the time of this writing, it is 'hg19').
				<p>
				In a typical sequencing experiment, you will find many places in the genome where your sample differs from the reference genome.
				These are called "genomic variants" or just "variants".
				<br>
				Typically, variants are catogorized as follows:
				<table class="table table-striped">
					<tr> <th> Name  </th> <th> What is means                    </th> <th> Example </th> </tr>
					<tr> <td> SNP   </td> <td> Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism   </td> <td> Reference = 'A', Sample = 'C' </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> Ins   </td> <td> Insertion                        </td> <td> Reference = 'A', Sample = 'AGT' </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> Del   </td> <td> Deletion                         </td> <td> Reference = 'AC', Sample = 'C' </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> MNP   </td> <td> Multiple-nucleotide polymorphism </td> <td> Reference = 'ATA', Sample = 'GTC' </td> </tr>
				</table>
				This is not a comprehensive list, it is just to give you an idea.
				</p>

				<p> <h3>Annotations</h3><br>
				So, you have a huge file describing all the differences between your sample and the reference genome.
				But you want to know more about these variants than just their genetic coordinates. 
				E.g.: Are they in a gene? In an exon? Do they change protein coding? Do they cause premature stop codons?
				<br>
				SnpEff can help you answer all these questions.
				The process of adding this information about the variants is called "Annotation".
				<br>
				SnpEff provides several degrees of annotations, from simple (e.g. which gene is each variant affecting) to exremelly complex annotations (e.g. will this non-coding variant affect the expreesion of a gene?).
				It should be noted that the more complex the annotations, the more it relies in computational predictions.
				Such somputational predictions are sometimes incorrect. 
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> Results cannot be trusted blindly. SnpEff results may have to analyzed and independently validated.
				</p>

				<p> <h3>Databases</h3><br>
				In order to produce the annotations, SnpEff requires a database.
				We build these databases using informations from trusted resources.
				<br>
				Currently, there are pre-built database for over 2,500 reference genomes.
				This means that 99% of the cases are covered.
				<br>
				In some very rare ocasions, people need to build a database for an organism not currently supported (e.g. the genome is not publicly available).
				In most cases, this can be done and there is a section of this manual teaching how to build your own SnpEff database.
				<br>
				If you have problems adding you own organism, send me an email and I'll do my best to help you out.<p>

				<p> <h3>Summary</h3><br>
				A typical SnpEff use case would be:
				<ul>
					<li> Input:
					The inputs are predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions and MNPs). 
					The input file is usually obtained as a result of a sequencing experiment, and it is usually in variant call format (VCF).
					<p>

					<li> Output:
					SnpEff analyzes the input variants. 
					It annotates the variants and calculates the effects they produce on known genes (e.g. amino acid changes).
					A list of effects and annotations that SnpEff can calculate can be found <a class="body" href="faq.html#What_effects_are_predicted?">here</a>.
				</ul>

        <!-- Download
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="install">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>2. Download &amp; Install</h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead"> Download and installing SnpEff it pretty easy. 
				</p>
				
				<p> <h3>System requirements </h3><br>
				SnpEff requires that you have Java v1.6 or later installed (any modern operating system has it). <br>
				You'll probably need at least 2Gb of memory. 
				The amount of memory used can vary significantly depending on genome size and data analysis type you are doing.

				<p> <h3>Downloading and Installing</h3><br>
				In order to download and install the program, you can follow the directions <a href="download.html">here</a>.

				<p> <h3> How is it licensed? </h3><br>
				SnpEff is open source. It is released mainly as "LGPLv3". If you prefer another open source license, just contact me and I'll try to add your preferred license as well. <br>

				<p> <h3>Source code </h3><br>
				The project is hosted at SourceForge. <br>
				Here is the SVN command to check out the development version of the code:
<pre>
svn co https://snpeff.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/snpeff/SnpEffect/trunk
</pre>

				<p> <h3>Configuration</h3><br>
				The only configuration file is "snpEff.config".
				Most configuration parameters, are explained in the comments in the same config file, so I won't repeat the explanation here :-)
				<br>
				Usually you will only need to change the "data_dir" parameter.
				This parameter points to the "data" directory where you installed the tool (i.e. in unix systems, this is $HOME/snpEff/data).<p>
        </section>

        <!-- Running SnpEff
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="run">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>3. Running SnpEff</h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead"> We show some basic examples how to use SnpEff.</p>

				<p><h3>Command line vs Web interface</h3><br>
				In order to run SnpEff you need to be comfortable running command from a command line terminal.
				If you are not, then it is probably a good idea to ask you systems adminitrator to install a <a class="body"class="body" href="http://usegalaxy.org">Galaxy</a> server and use the web interface.
				You can also use the open Galaxy server, but functionality may be limited and SnpEff versions may not be updated frequently.
				</p>

				<p><h3>Usage example</h3><br>
				In this example, we will annotate a variants file using the human reference genome.<br>

				As an input, we will use a <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41"> Variant Call Format (VCF) </a> file.
				VCF is the de-facto standard for genetic variants.
				<br>
				In this example we will use a file 'demo.1kg.vcf.gz', which is provided in the distribution.
<pre>
# Go to SnpEff install sirectory
cd ~/snpEff 

# Download human database 'hg19'
java -jar snpEff.jar download -v hg19

# Annotate 
java -Xmx2g -jar snpEff.jar hg19 -v demo.1kg.vcf > demo.1kg.snpeff.vcf
</pre>

				Here is an example of some entries in the annotated output file. 
				You can see the 'EFF' field was added, predicting STOP_GAINED protein changes:

<pre>
$ cat demo.1kg.snpeff.vcf | grep STOP_
1    889455    .    G    A    100.0    PASS    ...;EFF=STOP_GAINED(HIGH|NONSENSE|Cag/Tag|Q236*...
1    897062    .    C    T    100.0    PASS    ...;EFF=STOP_GAINED(HIGH|NONSENSE|Cag/Tag|Q141*...
1    900375    .    G    A    100.0    PASS    ...;EFF=STOP_GAINED(HIGH|NONSENSE|tGg/tAg|W578*...
</pre>
				Note: The real output was edited for readibility reasons.
				</p>

				<p><h3>Runnig from another directory</h3> <br>
				When you run SnpEff from a different directory than your install directory, you have to specify where the config file is located using the '-c' command line option.
<pre>
java -Xmx2g path/to/snpEff/snpEff.jar -c path/to/snpEff/snpEff.config GRCh37.70 path/to/snps.vcf
</pre>

				<p><h3>Java memory options</h3> <br>
				By default the amount of memory set by a java process is set too low.
				If you don't assigm more memory to the process, you will most likely have an "OutOfMemory" error.<br>

				You should set the amount of memory in your java virtual machine to, at least, 2 Gb. 
				This can be easily done using the Java command line option "-XmX".
				E.g. In this example I use 4Gb:
<pre>
# Run using 4 Gb of memory 
java -Xmx4G snpEff.jar hg19 path/to/your/files/snps.vcf
</pre>
				Note: There is no space between "-Xmx" and "4G".
				</p>

				<p><h3>Running SnpEff in the Cloud </h3> <br>
				You can run SnpEff in a "the Cloud" exactly the same way as running it on your local computer.
				You should not have any problems at all.
				<br>
				Here is an example of installing it and running it on an Amazon EC2 instance (virtual machine):<p>
<pre>
$ ssh -i ./aws_amazon/pcingola_aws.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-234-14-244.compute-1.amazonaws.com

       __|  __|_  )
       _|  (     /   Amazon Linux AMI
      ___|\___|___|


[ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 ~]$ wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/snpeff/files/snpEff_latest_core.zip
[ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 ~]$ unzip snpEff_latest_core.zip
[ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 ~]$ cd snpEff_3_1/
[ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 snpEff_3_1]$ java -jar snpEff.jar download -v hg19
00:00:00.000    Downloading database for 'hg19'
...
00:00:36.340    Done
[ec2-user@ip-10-2-202-163 snpEff_3_1]$ java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar dump -v hg19 > /dev/null
00:00:00.000    Reading database for genome 'hg19' (this might take a while)
00:00:20.688    done
00:00:20.688    Building interval forest
00:00:33.110    Done.
</pre>

				<p>
				As you can see, it's very simple.

				<p><h3>Command line options</h3> <br>
				In order to see all available options, you can run 
				<pre>java -jar snpEff.jar -help</pre>
				We'll explain many of those options in detail in the following chapters.
				</p>

				<p><h3>Loading the database</h3> <br>
				One of the first thins SnpEff has to do is to load the database.
				Usually it takes frmo a few seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on database size.
				Complex databases, like human, require more time to load.
				After the database is loaded, SnpEff can analyze thousands of variants per second.
				</p>

        <!-- Sequence data analysis
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="seqData">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>4. Sequence data analysis</h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead"> Here we show an example on how to get from Sequenceing data to an annotated variants file </p>

				<p><h3>Sequencing data example</h3> <br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> This is an extremelly simplified version on how to analyze the data from scratch
				This is not meant to be a tutorial on sequencing analysis as it would be way beyond the scope of this handbook.
				<br>
				Let's assume you have sequence data in FASTQ format (file "s.fastq") and your reference genome is dm5.34 (fly genome)
<pre>
# Download the genome, uncompress and rename file
wget ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r5.34_FB2011_02/fasta/dmel-all-chromosome-r5.34.fasta.gz
gunzip dmel-all-chromosome-r5.34.fasta.gz
mv dmel-all-chromosome-r5.34.fasta dm5.34.fasta

# Create a genome index (we assume you installed BWA http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
bwa index -bwtsw dm5.34.fasta

# Map sequences to the genome: Create SAI file
bwa aln -bwtsw dm5.34.fasta s.fastq > s.sai

# Map sequences to the genome: Create SAM file
bwa samse dm5.34.fasta s.sai s.fastq > s.sam

# Create BAM file (we assume you installed SamTools http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)
samtools view -S -b s.sam > s.bam

# Sort BAM file (will create s_sort.bam)
samtools sort s.bam s_sort

# Create VCF file (BcfTools is part of samtools distribution)
samtools mpileup -uf dm5.34.fasta s_sort.bam | bcftools view -vcg - > s.vcf

# Analyze variants using snpEff
java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar -vcf4 dm5.34 s.vcf > s_snpeff.txt
</pre>

				This highly simplified sequencing data analysis pipeline, has the common basic steps
				<ul>
					<li> Index the reference genome (bwa)
					<li> Map reads to reference genome (bwa)
					<li> Call varaints (bcftools)
					<li> Annotate variants (SnpEff)
				</ul>
				</p>
				
        <!-- Input
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="input">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>5. Input files </h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead"> 
				Files used as input to SnpEff must comply with standard formats.
				Here we describe supported input data formats.
				</p>
				
				<p><h3>VCF</h3> <br>
				As we mentioned before, <a class="body"class="body" href="http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41">Variant Call Format (VCF)</a> is the recomended format for input files.
				This is the format used by the "1000 Genomes Project", and is currently considered the de-facto standard for genomic variants.
				Furthermore, most variant calling programs output VCF files, so it is also the simplest format to use.
				<br>
				In a nutshell, VCF format is tab-separated text file having the following columns:

				<ol>
					<li> Chromosome name
					<li> Position
					<li> Variant's ID
					<li> Reference genome
					<li> Alteranative (i.e. variant)
					<li> Quality score
					<li> Filter (whether or not the variant passed quality filters)
					<li> INFO : Generic information about this variant. SnpEff adds annotation information in this column.
				</ol>

				Here is an exampls of a few lines in a VCF file:
<pre>
#CHROM POS     ID        REF    ALT     QUAL FILTER INFO                    
20     14370   rs6054257 G      A       29   PASS   NS=3;DP=14;AF=0.5;DB;H2
20     17330   .         T      A       3    q10    NS=3;DP=11;AF=0.017   
</pre>
				Note that the first line is header information. Header lines start with '#'
				<p>

				<p><h3>TXT</h3><br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> TXT format is currently deprecated and discurraged.
				<br>
				TXT file format must be tab-separated, containing columns that correspond to:
				<ul>
					<li>chromosome_name
					<li>chromosome_position
					<li>reference sequence
					<li>changed sequence: A slash is used to separate two alleles
					<li>strand: {+,-} (optional)
					<li>quality (optional)
					<li>coverage (optional)
				</ul>

				This is an example of an input TXT file:

<pre>
5   140532    T    C       +
12  1017956   T    A       +    45    12
2   946507    G    C       +    23    8
14  19584687  C    T       -
19  66520     G    -G/-G   +
8   150029    A    */+T    +
</pre>

				<p><b>TXT: Representing an heterozygous variant</b><br> 
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> TXT format is currently deprecated and discurraged.
				<br>
				When representing a heterozygous SNP you can use IUB codes: M=A/C, R=A/G, W=A/T, S=C/G, Y=C/T and K=G/T. 
				Indels are indicated by, for example, */+A, -A/* or +CC/-C. There is no difference between */+A or +A/*.

        <!-- Output
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="output">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>6. Output files </h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead"> 
				Here we describe the format of SnpEff's output files and the information added.
				</p>

				<p><h3>VCF output format</h3>
				<br> 
				<br> 
				As we mentioned in the previous chapter, VCF is the default input format.
				It is highly recomended to use VCF as input and output format, since it is a standard format that can be also used by other tools and software packages.
				Thus VCF makes it much easier to integrate genomic data processing pipelines.
				<br>
				SnpEff adds annotation information to the INFO field of a VCF file.
				The INFO field is the eigth column of a VCF file, see previous section for a quick example or take a look at the <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41">VCF specification</a> for details.
				<br>
				<br>
				Here is an example of a file before and after being annotated using SnpEff:
				<br>
				VCF file before annotations
<pre>
#CHROM POS     ID        REF    ALT     QUAL FILTER INFO                    
1	889455	.	G	A	100.0	PASS	AF=0.0005
1	897062	.	C	T	100.0	PASS	AF=0.0005
</pre>

				VCF file after being annotated using SnpEff
<pre>
#CHROM POS     ID        REF    ALT     QUAL FILTER INFO                    
1	889455	.	G	A	100.0	PASS	AF=0.0005;EFF=STOP_GAINED(HIGH|NONSENSE|Cag/Tag|Q236*|749|NOC2L||CODING|NM_015658|)
1	897062	.	C	T	100.0	PASS	AF=0.0005;EFF=STOP_GAINED(HIGH|NONSENSE|Cag/Tag|Q141*|642|KLHL17||CODING|NM_198317|)
</pre>
				A you can see, SnpEff added an 'EFF' tag to the INFO field (eigth column).
				</p>

				<p><b>VCF EFF field</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				Effects information is added to the INFO field using an 'EFF' tag. 

				There can be multiple effects separated by comma. The format for each effect is:
				<br>

				<p><b>VCF Header lines </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				SnpEff updates the header of the VCF file to reflect aditional fields.
				This is required by the VCF specification.
				SnpEff also adds the command line options used to annotate the file as well as SnpEff's version, so you can keep track of what exactly was done.
				<br>
				<br>
				Here is an example of some header lines added to an anotated file:
<pre>
##SnpEffVersion="SnpEff 3.1m (build 2013-02-08)"
##SnpEffCmd="SnpEff  hg19 demo.1kg.vcf "
##INFO=&lt;ID=EFF,Number=.,Type=String,Description="Predicted effects for this variant.Format: 'Effect ( Effect_Impact | Functional_Class | Codon_Change | Amino_Acid_change| Amino_Acid_length | Gene_Name | Gene_BioType | Coding | Transcript | Exon [ | ERRORS | WARNINGS ] )' \"&gt;
</pre>
				</p>

				<br> 
				<p><b>Mutiple effects per VCF line</b>
				<br> 
				<br> 
				Usually there is more than one effect reported in each EFF field.
				<br>
				There are several reasons for this:
				<ul>
					<li> A variant can affect multple genes. E.g a variant can be DOWNSTREAM from one gene and UPSTREAM from another gene.
					<li> In complex organisms, genes usually have mutiple transcripts. So SnpEff reports the effect of a variant on each transcript.
					<li> A VCF line can have more then one variant. 
						 For instance if reference genome is 'G', but the sample has either 'A' or 'T', then this will be reported as one line, having multiple alternative variants. 
						 E.g.: 
<pre>
#CHROM  POS       ID   REF  ALT      QUAL  FILTER  INFO                    
1       889455    .    G    A,T      .     .       AF=0.0005
</pre>
						In this case SnpEff will report the effect of each variant on each gene and each transcript.
				</ul>
				</p>

				<br>
				<p> <b> Counting total number of effects of a given type </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				Some people try to count the number of effects in a file by doing (assuming we want to count how many MODIFIER efefcts we have): 
				<br>
				<pre> grep -o MODIFIER output.eff.vcf | wc -l </pre>
				<br>
				This is incorrect because a VCF line can have multiple effects (e.g. when there are multiple transcripts in a gene).
				A proper way to count effects would be:

<pre>
cat output.eff.vcf \
	| cut -f 8 \
	| tr ";" "\n" \
	| grep ^EFF= \
	| cut -f 2 -d = \
	| tr "," "\n" \
	| grep MODIFIER \
	| wc -l
</pre>

				Brief explanation:
				<table class="table table-striped">
					<tr> <td> <tt>cut -f 8 </tt> </td> <td>  Extract INFO fields </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> <tt>tr ";" "\n" </tt> </td> <td>  Expand each field into one line </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> <tt>grep ^EFF= </tt> </td> <td>  Only keep 'EFF' fields </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> <tt>cut -f 2 -d = </tt> </td> <td>  Keep only the effect data (drop the 'EFF=' part) </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> <tt>tr "," "\n" </tt> </td> <td>  Expand effects to multiple lines </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> <tt>grep MODIFIER | wc -l </tt> </td> <td>  Count the ones you want (in this example 'MODIFIER')</td> </tr>
				</table>

				<p><h3>TXT output format</h3>
				<br> 
				<br> 
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> TXT format is currently deprecated and discurraged.
				<br>
				The TXT output format consist of one line per effect. 
				This means that you usually get more than one line per SNP since the same SNP may affect several different transcripts in the same gene.
				<br>
				<br>
				The format consist of tab separated columns:
				<center>
				<table class="table table-striped">

				<i> Meaning of 'Degeneracy' column </i>: Here is an explanation form Stephen Wright (Univ. Toronto), who requested to add this feature
	  
<pre>
	     "...a fourfold degenerate site would be a site where any change is synonymous. So the 
	     third codon position for the arginine CGN, is a fourfold degenerate site, as is the 
	     third codon position for valine, alanine, etc.
	     Similarly, all second positions of a codon are zerofold degenerate, since any change is 
	     nonsynonymous. Many first codon positions are also zerofold degenerate, however, for 
	     example, the first codon position of AGG is NOT zerofold, because a shift to CGG is a 
	     synonymous change."
</pre>
				</p>

				<br>
				<p> <b> Details about Hom/Het calculation (summary file and TXT output format) </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				In older formats, there used to be one sample per file, so 
				identifying Hom/Het in a per variant basis made sense.
				<br>
				<br>
				In VCF files, where many samples are analyzed simultaneously, 
				identification of Hom/Het should be done in a per sample basis 
				instead of per variant basis. In an attempt to output that field I 
				used a majority vote (i.e. if most samples are Hom, I output 
				Hom, otherwise, Het). This is not strictly correct and, it 
				may also be confusing.
				<br>
				<br>
				For this reason, the output is empty when using multi-sample files, such as VCF. 
				Unless the file contains only one sample (i.e. only one genotype field)
				</p>

				<br>
				<p> <b> Coordinates differences between VCT and TXT outputs </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				There are some situations when there seems to be a difference between TXT output coordinates and VCF output coordinates.
				This happens because sometimes VCF files have a coordinate that does not start exactly were the variant is. 
				Here is an example:
				<pre>
VCF line:                   "chr10   102770293       .       tgctgcggctgcggctgcggctacggctgcggct      tGCTGCGgctgcggctgcggctgcggctacggctgcggct"
INS reported by SnpEff:     "chr10   102770315       *       +GCGGCT INS"
</pre>
<p>

				At first glace, these two look different, since 102770293 is not the same as 102770315. 
				But if you look at the sequences:

<pre>
tgctgcggctgcggctgcggct      acggctgcggct    REF (from VCF file)
||||||||||||||||||||||      ||||||||||||
tgctgcggctgcggctgcggctgcggctacggctgcggct    ALT (from VCF file)
|      |         |    |||||| 
|      |         |    gcggct                INS (reported by SnpEff TXT format)
|      |         |    |
102770293        |    |                     Position (VCF)
       |         |    |
       102770300 |    |
                 |    |
                 102770310
                      |
                      102770315             Position (TXT)
</pre>
				So the two VCF and TXT representations are equivalent.
				</p>

				SnpEff creates an additional output file showing overall statistics.

				You can find an example of a 'stats' file <a href="1kg.html"> here</a>.
				</p>

				The program performs some statistics and saves them to the file 'snpEff_summary.html' on the

				</p>

				<br>
				<p> <b> "Effects by type" vs "Effects by region" </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				SnpEff annotates variants. 
				Variants produce effect of difference "types" (e.g. NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, STOP_GAINED). 
				These variants affect regions of the genome (e.g. EXON, INTRON). 
				The two tables count how many effects for each type and for each region exists.
				<br>
				E.g.: In an EXON region, you can have all the following effect types:	NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING, SYNONYMOUS_CODING, FRAME_SHIFT, STOP_GAINED, etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				The complicated part is that some effect types affect a region that has the same name (yes, I know, this is confusing).
				<br>
				E.g.: In a UTR_5_PRIME region you can have UTR_5_PRIME and START_GAINED effect type. <br>
				<br>
				<br>
				This means that the number of both tables are not exactly the same, because the labels don't mean the same.
				See the next figure as an example
				<br>
				<img width=700 src="images/type_vs_region.png">
				<br>
				So the number of effects that affect a UTR_5_PRIME <i>region</i> is 206. Of those, 57 are effects <i>type</i> START_GAINED and 149 are effects <i>type</i> UTR_5_PRIME.
				<br>
				How exactly are effect <i>type</i> and effect <i>region</i> related? See the following table<p>

				<br>
				<p> <b>Details about Rare amino acid effect </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				These are amino acids that occurs very rarely in an organism.
				For instance, humans are supposed to use 20 amino acids, but
				there is also one rare AA. Selenocysteine, single letter
				code 'U', appears roughly 100 times in the whole genome.
				The amino acid is so rare that usually it does not appear 
				in codon translation tables. It is encoded as UGA, which usually 
				means a STOP codon. Secondary RNA 
				structures are assumed to enable this special translation.
				<br>
				<br>
				A variant in one of these sites is likely to cause a loss of 
				function in the protein. E.g. in case of a Selenocysteine, a 
				loss of a selenium molecule is likely to cause loss of function.
				Put it simply, the assumption is that there is a great deal of trouble 
				to get that non-standard amino acid there, so it must be important.
				RARE_AMINO_ACID mark is used to show that special attention should 
				be paid in these cases.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> When the variant hits a RARE_AMINO_ACID mark, it is likely that 
				the 'old_AA/new_AA' field will be incorrect. This may happen because 
				the amino acid is not predictable using a codon table. 
				</p>

				<br>
				<p><h3>Effect impact</h3>
				<br>
				<br>
				Efefcts are categorized by 'impact': {High, Moderate, Low, Modifier}. 
				This are pre-defined categories to help users find more significant variants.
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> Categories must be used with care, they were created only to help and simplify the filtering process. 
				Obviously, there is no way to predict wether a "high impact" or a "low impact" variant is the one producing you phenotype of interest.
				<br>
				<br>
				Impact categories:

				<p> <h3> Loss of function and nonsense-mediated decay predictions </h3>
				<br>
				<br>
				Loss of function ('LOF') and nonsense-mediated decay ('NMD') predictions can be activated by using '-lof' command line opion.
				Details on how these variants work, can be found in <a class="body" href="snpEff_lof_nmd.pdf">these slides </a>
				<br>
				Usage example:
<pre>
java –Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar –v \
	-lof \
	GRCh37.68 \
	file.vcf.gz > file.eff.vcf
</pre>

				SnpEff adds 'LOF' and 'MND' tags to INFO fields (column 8 in VCF format).  LOF and NMD tags have the following format:
<pre>
Gene | ID | num_transcripts | percent_affected
</pre>
				Where:
				<table class="table table-striped">
					<tr> <th> Field            </th><th> Description </th> </tr>
					<tr> <td> Gene             </td><td> Gene name </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> ID               </td><td> Gene ID (usually ENSEMBL) </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> Num_transcripts  </td><td> Number of transcripts in this gene </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> percent_affected </td><td> Percentage of transcripts affected by this variant. </td> </tr>
				</table>

				<br>
				Example: If we have this effect
<pre>
EFF=…, SPLICE_SITE_DONOR(HIGH||||639|ILDR2|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000271417|1)
</pre>

				and the corresponding LOF tag is
<pre>
LOF=ILDR2|ENSG00000143195|7|1.00
</pre>

				The meaning of the LOF tag is:
				<table class="table table-striped">
					<tr> <th> Field            </th><th> Description </th> </tr>
					<tr> <td> Gene             </td><td> ILDR2 </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> ID               </td><td> ENSG00000143195 </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> Num_transcripts  </td><td> There are 7 transcripts in this gene </td> </tr>
					<tr> <td> percent_affected </td><td> 100% of transcripts are affected by this variant. </td> </tr>
				</table>

				<h3> Troubleshooting </h3>

				<p> <b> Apparent inconsistencies when using UCSC genome browser </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> <b>WARNING:</b> Usage of hg19 genome is deprecated and discouraged, you should use GRChXX.YY instead (e.g. the latest version at the time of writing is GRCh37.70)
				<br>
				<br>
				Reference sequence and annotations are made for an organism version and sub-version. 
				For examples human genome, version 37, sub-version 70 would be called (GRCh37.70).
				<br>
				UCSC doesn't specify sub-version. 
				They just say hg19.
				This annoying sub-version problem appeared often and, having reproducibility of results in mind, I dropped UCSC annotations in favor of ENSEMBL ones (they have clear versioning).
				</p>

				<p> <b> SnpEff reporting an effect that doesn't match ENSEMBL's web page </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				Please remember that databases are updated often (e.g. by ENSEMBL), so if you are using an old database, you might get different effects.<br>
				<br>
				For example, this transcript ENST00000487462 changed from protein_coding in GRCh37.63 
<pre>
1       protein_coding  exon    1655388 1655458 .       -       .        gene_id "ENSG00000008128"; transcript_id "ENST00000487462"; exon_number "1"; gene_name "CDK11A"; transcript_name "CDK11A-013";
1       protein_coding  exon    1653905 1654270 .       -       .        gene_id "ENSG00000008128"; transcript_id "ENST00000487462"; exon_number "2"; gene_name "CDK11A"; transcript_name "CDK11A-013";
</pre>
...to processed_transcript in GRCh37.64:
<pre>
1       processed_transcript    exon    1655388 1655458 .       -       .        gene_id "ENSG00000008128"; transcript_id "ENST00000487462"; exon_number "1"; gene_name "CDK11A"; gene_biotype "protein_coding"; transcript_name "CDK11A-013";
1       processed_transcript    exon    1653905 1654270 .       -       .        gene_id "ENSG00000008128"; transcript_id "ENST00000487462"; exon_number "2"; gene_name "CDK11A"; gene_biotype "protein_coding"; transcript_name "CDK11A-013";
</pre>

				This means that you'll get different results for this transcript using sub-version 63 or 64. I assume that latest versions are improved, so I always encourage to upgrade.
				<br>
				Sometimes it might even be the case that latest released dataabse and the one shown on the web interface may be out of sync.
				<br>
				</p>

				<p> <b> SnpEff reports a SYNONYMOUS and a NON_SYNONYMOUS effect on the same gene </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				This is not a bug.
				It is not uncommon for a gene to have more than one transcript (e.g. in human most genes have multiple transcripts). 
				A variant (e.g. a SNP) might affect different transcripts in different ways, as a result of different reading frames.
				<br>
				For instance: 
<pre>
chr5 137622242 . C T . . EFF=NON_SYNONYMOUS_CODING(MODERATE|MISSENSE|Gaa/Aaa|E/K|CDC25C|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000514017|exon_5_137622186_137622319),
                             SYNONYMOUS_CODING(LOW|SILENT|caG/caA|Q|CDC25C|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000323760|exon_5_137622186_137622319),

                             SYNONYMOUS_CODING(LOW|SILENT|caG/caA|Q|CDC25C|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000356505|exon_5_137622186_137622319),
                             SYNONYMOUS_CODING(LOW|SILENT|caG/caA|Q|CDC25C|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000357274|exon_5_137622186_137622319),

                             SYNONYMOUS_CODING(LOW|SILENT|caG/caA|Q|CDC25C|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000513970|exon_5_137622186_137622319),
                             SYNONYMOUS_CODING(LOW|SILENT|caG/caA|Q|CDC25C|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000514555|exon_5_137622186_137622319),
                             SYNONYMOUS_CODING(LOW|SILENT|caG/caA|Q|CDC25C|protein_coding|CODING|ENST00000534892|exon_5_137622186_137622319)
</pre>

				in this example (it was divided into multiple lines for legibility), the first transcript ENST0000051401 has a NON_SYNONYMOUS effect, but all other transcripts have a SYNONYMOUS effect.

        <section id="filters">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>8. Output filters </h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead">
				We describe how to filter the out or narrow down the number of results.
				</p>


				<p><b>Annotating only some intervals</b><br> 
				You can use the '-fi' option (a.k.a. '-filterInterval). For instance, let's assume you have an interval file 'intervals.bed':
<pre>2L	10000	10999
2L	12000	12999
2L	14000	14999
2L	16000	16999
2L	18000	18999 </pre>
				In order to get only changes that match your intervals, you can use the command:
<pre> java -Xmx4G -jar snpEff.jar -fi intervals.bed dm5.30 file.vcf</pre>
<b>Note:</b> You may specify multiple files by using '-fi' many times.


        <!-- Databases
        ================================================== -->
        <section id="databases">
          <div class="page-header">
            <h1>9. Databses </h1>
          </div>
				<p class="lead">
				SnpEff needs a datbase to perform genomic annotations. 
				There are pre-built databases for over 2,500 genomes, so chances are that your organism of coice already has a SnpEff database available.
				In the (unlikely?) event that you need to build one yourself, here we descrive how to it.
				</p>

				<p>
				<i class="icon-hand-right"></i>You can know which genomes are supported by running the following command:
<pre>
java -jar snpEff.jar databases
</pre>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> Most people do NOT need to build a database, and can safely use a pre-built one. 
				So unless you are working with an rare genome you most likely don't need to do it either.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> Again, chances are that you DO NOT NEED to build a database.
				Sorry to repeat this, but I cannot tell how many times I get emails asking for help to build database that is already available.
				<br>
				<br>
				In order to add support for a new genome, you need to:
				<ol>
					<li> Get the reference genome sequence (e.g. in FASTA format).
					<li> Get genome annotations. It can be either:
						<ol>
							<li> GTF file (the easiest way) 
							<li> GFF file.
							<li> RefSeq (UCSC) table.
							<li> GenBank
						</ol>
					<li> Add genome to snpEff's configuration file
					<li> Run a command to create the database (i.e. "java -jar snpEff.jar build ...")
				</ol>

				<b>Note:</b> All files can be compressed using gzip. E.g. the reference file 'hg19.fa' can be compressed to 'hg19.fa.gz', snpEff will automatically decompress the file.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i><b>Warning:</b> Some files claimed to be compressed using GZIP are actually not or even use a block compression variant not supported by Java's gzip library.
				If you notice that your build process finishes abruptly for no aparent reason, try uncompressing the files. 
				This sometimes happens with ENSEMBL files.
				</p>

				<h3>Option 1: Building a database from GTF files</h3>
				<p>
				GTF 2.2 files are supported by SnpEff (e.g. ENSEMBL relases genome annotations in this format).
				<ol>
					<li> Get the genome and uncompress it
<pre>
# Create directoy for this new genome
cd /path/to/snpEff/data/
mkdir mm37.61
cd mm37.61

# Get annotation files
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.gtf.gz
mv Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.gtf.gz genes.gtf.gz

# Get the genome
cd /path/to/snpEff/data/genomes
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.dna.toplevel.fa.gz
mv Mus_musculus.NCBIM37.61.dna.toplevel.fa.gz mm37.61.fa.gz
</pre>

					<li> <b>Note:</b> The FASTA file can be either in <br> <tt>/path/to/snpEff/data/genomes/mm37.61.fa</tt> <br> or in <br> <tt>/path/to/snpEff/data/mm37.61/sequences.fa</tt><p>

					<li> Add the new genome to the config file (see section "How to add a new genome to the configuration file" for details)

					<li> Create database
<pre>
cd /path/to/snpEff
java -jar snpEff.jar build -gtf22 -v mm37.61 
</pre>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Option 2: Building a database from GFF files </h3>
				<p>
				This example shows how to create a database for a new genome using GFF file ((e.g. FlyBase, WormBase, BeeBase release GFF files). 
				For this example we'll use the Drosophila melanogaster genome (dm5.31):
				<ol>
					<li> Get a GFF file (into path/to/snpEff/data/dm5.31/genes.gff):

<pre>
mkdir path/to/snpEff/data/dm5.31
cd path/to/snpEff/data/dm5.31
wget ftp://ftp.flybase.net/genomes/Drosophila_melanogaster/dmel_r5.31_FB2010_08/gff/dmel-all-r5.31.gff.gz
mv dmel-all-r5.31.gff.gz genes.gff.gz 
</pre>

					<li> <b>Note:</b> GFF3 files can include the reference sequence in the same file. This is done by dumping the fasta file after a '##FASTA' line. You can also add the sequence fasta file to the 'data/genomes/' directory, like it is done in when using GTF format.

					<li> Add the new genome to the config file (see section "How to add a new genome to the configuration file" for details)

					<li> Create database (note the "-gff3" flag):
<pre>
cd /path/to/snpEff
java -jar snpEff.jar build -gff3 -v dm5.31 
</pre>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Option 3: Building a database from RefSeq table from UCSC</h3>
				<p>
				This example shows how to create a database for a new genome. 
				For this example we'll use the Human genome (hg19).
				<br>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i><b>Warning:</b> Using UCSC genome tables is highly discurraged, we recomend you use ENSEMBL versions instead.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i><b>Warning:</b> UCSC tables sometimes change for different species. 
				This means that even if these instructions work for human genome, it might not work for other genomes.
				Obviously creating a new parser for each genome is impractical, so working with UCSC genomes is higly discurraged.
				We recommend to use ENSEMBL genomes instead.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i><b>Warning:</b> UCSC genomes provide only major release version, but NOT sub-versions.
				E.g. UCSC's "hg19" has major version 19 but there is no "sub-version", whereas ENSEMBL's GRCh37.70 clearly has major version 37 and minor version 70. 
				Not providing a minor version means that they might change the database and two "hg19" genomes are actually be different.
				This creates all sorts of consitency problems (e.g. the annotations may not be the same that you see in the UCSC genome browser, even though both of them are 'hg19' version).
				Using UCSC genome tables is highly discurraged, we recomend you use ENSEMBL versions instead.
				<br>
				<br>
				In order to build a genome using UCSC tables, you can follow these instructions:
				<ol>
					<li> Go to UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/)
					<li> Click on "Table" menu
					<li> Select parameters as shown here:
							<br>
							<img src="./images/ucsc_refSeq.png">
							<br>
					<li> Click on "get output" and save the data to file "/path/to/snpEff/data/hg19/genes.txt".

					<li> Add the fasta reference genome. The FASTA file can be either in <br> <tt>/path/to/snpEff/data/genomes/hg19.fa</tt> <br> or in <br> <tt>/path/to/snpEff/data/hg19/sequences.fa</tt><p>

					<li> <a class="body" href="#conf">Add</a> the new genome to the config file (see section "How to add a new genome to the configuration file" for details)

					<li> Create database (note the "-refSeq" flag):
<pre>
cd /path/to/snpEff
java -jar snpEff.jar build -refSeq -v hg19 
</pre>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h3>Option 4: Building a database from GenBank files</h3>
				<p>
				This example shows how to create a database for a new genome. 
				For this example we'll use "Staphylococcus aureus":
				<ol>
					<li> Go to NIH page for <a class="body" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP000730.1">CP000730</a>

					<li> Download the features in geneBank format, by clicking as shown in the following images (red arrows)
						<br>
						<br>
						<center> <img width=800 src="images/genBank_0.png"> </center> 
						<br>
						<br>
						Make sure you click the "Update" button!
						<br>
						Then you go to the "Send" menu
						<br>
						<br>
						<center> <img width=800 src="images/genBank_1.png"> </center>
						<br>
						<br>
						and then
						<br>
						<br>
						<center> <img width=800 src="images/genBank_2.png"> </center>
						<br>
						<br>

					<li> Save the GenBank data to "/path/to/snpEff/data/CP000730/genes.gb".
						<br>
						<br>
						 <b>Note:</b> If there are more than one genbank file for an organism (e.g. multiple chromosomes), then you can download each file and save them separately.
						<br>
						 E.g.: Vibrio Cholerae has two chromosomes with GenBank accessions: NC_002505.1 and NC_002506.1.
						 You can download both files and save them as snpEff/data/vibrio/NC_002505.1.gb and snpEff/data/vibrio/NC_002506.1.gb respectively.
						 Then you can add the following entries in the config file:
						<br>
						<br>
<pre>
# Vibrio Cholerae
vibrio.genome : Vibrio Cholerae
	vibrio.chromosomes : NC_002505.1, NC_002506.1
	vibrio.NC_002505.1.codonTable : Bacterial_and_Plant_Plastid
	vibrio.NC_002506.1.codonTable : Bacterial_and_Plant_Plastid
</pre>

						SnpEff will load both files when building the database.

					<li> Create database (note the "-genbank" flag):
						<br>
						<br>
<pre>
	cd /path/to/snpEff
	java -jar snpEff.jar build -genbank -v CP000730 
</pre>
				</ol>
				</pre>
				</p>

				<h3>Add a genome to the configuration file</h3>
				<p>
				This example shows how to add a new genome to the config files. For this example we'll use the mouse genome (mm37.61):
				<br>
				<br>
				<ol>
					<li> Edit the config file to create the new genome

						<pre> vi snpEffect.config </pre>
							
						Add the following lines (you are editting snpEffect.config)<br>
<pre>
# Mouse genome, version mm37.61
mm37.61.genome : Mouse 
</pre>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i><b>Warning:</b> You may need to add codon table information for the genome or some parts of it (e.g. mitochondrial "chromosome"). 
				See next section for details.
				<br>
				<br>

					<li> Optional: Add genome to Galaxy's menu 
<pre>
cd /path/to/galaxy
cd tools/snpEffect/
vi snpEffect.xml 
</pre>

						Add the following lines to the file
<pre>
	&lt;param name="genomeVersion" type="select" label="Genome"&gt;
		&lt;option value="hg37"&gt;Human (hg37)&lt;option&gt;
		&lt;option value="mm37.61"&gt;Mouse (mm37.61)&lt;option&gt;
	&lt;param&gt; 
</pre>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h3> Configuring codon tables </h3>
				<p>
				Codon tables are provided in the <code>snpEff.config</code> configuration file under the section <code>codon.Name_of_your_codon_table</code>.
				The format is a comma separaated list of <code>CODON/AMINO_ACID</code>. 
				<br>
				E.g.: 
<pre>
codon.Invertebrate_Mitochondrial:  TTT/F, TTC/F, TAC/Y, TAA/*, ATG/M+, ATG/M+, ACT/T, ...
</pre>
				Note that codons marked with '*' are STOP codons and codons marked with a '+' are START codons.
				<br>
				<br>
				In order for you to use them, you have to specify that a given "chromosome" uses one of the tables (otherwise the default codon table is used).
				<br>
				E.g. Here we say the chromosome 'M' from fly genome (dm3) uses Invertebrate_Mitochondrial codon table:
<pre>

				<h3>Example: Building the Human Genome database</h3>
				<p>
				This is a full example on how to build the human genome database (using GTF file from ENSEBML), it includes support for regulatory features, sanity check, rare amino acids, etc..

# Uncompress: 
# Why do we need to uncompress? 
# Because ENSEMBL compresses files using a block compress gzip which is not compatibles whith Java's library Gunzip 
gunzip GRCh37.70.fa.gz

# Edit snpEff.config file
#
# WARNING! You must do this yourself. Just copying and pasting this into a terminal won't work.

				<h3> Troubleshooting </h3>
				<br>
				<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i><b>Warning:</b> By far the most common problem is that the FASTA file chromosome names are different than the GFF chromosome names.
				Make sure chromosome names are consistent in all the files you use.
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> 
				<b> When I build the database using GFF 3 SnpEff reports that Exons don't have sequences</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				GFF3 files can have sequence information either in the same file or in a separate fasta file.
				<br>
				In order to add sequence information in the GFF file, you can do this:
<pre>
cat annotations.gff > genes.gff
echo "###"  >> genes.gff
echo "##FASTA"  >> genes.gff
cat sequence.fa  >> genes.gff
</pre>
				</p>

				<p> <b> When building a database, I get zero protein coding genes </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				When building a database, snpEff tries to find which transcripts are protein coding. This is done using the 'bioType' information.
				<br>
				The bioType information is not a standard GFF or GTF feature. So I follow ENSEMBL's convention of using the second column ('source') for bioType, as well as the gene_biotype attribute.
				<br>
				If your file was not produced by ENSEMBL, it probably doesn't have this information. This means that snpEff doesn't know which genes are protein coding and which ones are not. 
				<br>
				Having no information, snpEff will treat all genes as protein coding (assuming you have '-treatAllAsProteinCoding Auto' option in the command line, which is the default).
				<br>
				So you will get effects as if all genes were protein coding, then you can filter out the irrelevant genes. unfortunately, this is the best I can do if there is no 'bioType' information 
				</p>

				<p> <b> When building a database, I get too many warnings </b>
				<br>
				<br>
				There are plenty of GFF and GTF files that, unfortunately, do not follow the specification. 
				SnpEff usually complains about this, but tries hard to correct the problems. 
				So the database may be OK even after you see many warnings.
				<br>
				You can check the database to see if the features (genes, exons, UTRs) have been correctly incorporated, by taking a look at the database:
<pre>
java -jar snpEff.jar dump myGenome | less
</pre>
				</p>

				<h1>10. Integration: GATK &amp; Galaxy </h1>
			  </div>
					<p class="lead">
					<p style="font-size: 14pt"> <b> <a class="body" name="gatk"> What is the adequate output for GATK? </a> </b></p>
					You should use the <b>'-o gatk'</b> command line option to avoid problems.
					The reason is that, even though GATK uses VCF, but sometimes new formats of the 'EFF' info field might cause trouble.
					This happens when switching from SnpEff v2.X to SnpEff v3.0, since the latest GATK version still uses an older format.<br>



					<p style="font-size: 14pt"> <b> <a class="body" name="How_do_I_add_support_for_regulatory_annotations?"> How do I add support for regulatory annotations? </a> </b></p>
					<a class="body"class="body" href="supportRegulation.html">Here</a> is a detailed, step by step explanation.

				<center> <p> <b> Unexpected results </b></center></p>

				<p style="font-size: 14pt"> <b> <a class="body" name="Why_are_coordinates_changed_in_InDels?"> Why are coordinates changed in InDels?  </a> </b></p>

				This is not a bug, just a feature of VCF input files.
				Suppose that you have an InDel like this one

<pre>10      7797903 .       CAACTA  CAACTAACTA      214     .       INDEL;DP=94;AF1=1;AC1=2;DP4=0,0,90,0;MQ=53;FQ=-290      GT:PL:GQ        1/1:255,255,0:99</pre>

				After running snpEff, you get an output like this

<pre>10      7797909 *       +ACTA   INS     Hom     214     94              ENSG00000151657 KIN     protein_coding  ENST00000463666 exon_10_7797777_7798105 6       FRAME_SHIFT: ENST00000463666                            699</pre>

				Although it may seem like a change of coordinated (from 7797903 to 7797909) it not.
				If you look at the sequences, the first 6 bases are the same (i.e. the VCF file says that the INDEL is "CAACTA / CAACTAACTA" at position 7797903).
				So the actual insertion is "ACTA" a position 7797903 + 6 = 7797909.

				<p style="font-size: 14pt"> <b> <a class="body" name="When_I_run_SnpEff_from_GATK_I_only_get_one_effect!"> When I run SnpEff from GATK I only get one effect! </a> </b></p>
				Indeed,  the GATK team decided to only report the highest impact effect. This was done intentionally for the sake of brevity, in a 'less is more' spirit.<br>
				You can get the full effect by using snpEff independently (instead of using it from GATK).

				<center> <p style="font-size: 16pt"> <b> Other utilities </b></center></p>
				<p style="font-size: 14pt"> <b> <a class="body" name="countReads"> SnpEff countReads: Counting how many reads / bases from a BAM file hit a gene, transcript, exon, intron, etc. </a> </b></p>
				If you need to count how many reads (and bases) from a BAM file hit each genomic region, you can use 'countReads' utility.<br>
				The command line is quite simple. E.g. in order to count how many reads (from N BAM files) hit regions of the human genome, you simply run: <br>
<pre>
java -Xmx4g -jar snpEff.jar countReads GRCh37.68 readsFile_1.bam readsFile_2.bam ...  readsFile_N.bam > countReads.txt 
</pre>
				<p>
				The output is a TXT (tab-separated) file, that looks like this:
